# Freshdesk.NET - Freshdesk REST Client
The Freshdesk REST Client is designed to abstract Freshdesk's JSON API and present the developer with a simplified and strongly typed implementation. Much of the underlying mechanics have therefore purposefully been abstracted behind private modifiers.

## Release Notes
The current release notes can be read in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jscarle/Freshdesk.NET/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Dependencies
Both [RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp) and [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) are required dependencies.

## Quick Start
Make sure to consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/jscarle/Freshdesk.NET/wiki) for the full documentation.

FreshdeskClient freshdesk = new FreshdeskClient(freshdeskDomain, apiKey, "X");
```

### Retrieving all contacts
```csharp
(Response response, List<Contact> contacts) = freshdesk.GetContacts();
if (response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK)
    Console.WriteLine(contacts.Count);
```

### Retrieving a single contact
```csharp
(Response response, Contact contact) = freshdesk.GetContact(28000000000);
